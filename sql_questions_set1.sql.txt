1. How to find duplicates record in a table.

select emp_id, emp_name, count(*)
from employee table
group by emp_id, emp_name
having  count(*) >1;

Note: HAVING filters on aggregate functions should come after Group by clause

or

SELECT a.*
FROM students a
JOIN (SELECT name, gender, COUNT(*)
FROM students 
GROUP BY name, gender
HAVING count(*) > 1 ) b
ON a.name = b.name
AND a.gender = b.gender
ORDER BY a.id;

Note: The first SELECT simply picks all of the columns in the user's table and then does an inner join with the duplicate data table from the first query. The two copies of the table must be identified by aliases (in this case, a and b) since we are connecting the table to itself.


2. Delete duplicate records from the table.

Delete from customer_data
Where rowid not in
(select max(rowid) from customer_data group_by cust_id);


3. Difference between union and union all

4. Difference between rank, rwonumber, dense_rank

5. Find records in a table which are not present in another table

Select employeeSalary. * from employeeSalary
Left join managerSalary
On employeeSalary.empID and managerSalary.empID

6. Write an SQL query to fetch all the Employees who are also managers from the EmployeeDetails table.

Select distinct E.FullName from EmployeeDetails E
Inner join EmployeeDetails M
Where E.empid = M.ManagerID;

7. Difference between inner join and left join

8. update a table and swap gender values
